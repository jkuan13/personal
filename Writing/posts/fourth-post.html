    <p class="c2"><span class="c3"><strong>THIS IS A PORTRAIT OF DON VALENTINE AND THE ROOTS AND BEGINNINGS OF SEQUOIA.</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Don was born at a time when veterans of America&rsquo;s Civil War were still alive.
            When he entered the U.S. Army in 1954, there was not a satellite in the sky. In the early 1960s, when he
            moved to Northern California, American schools regularly conducted drills for nuclear attacks and millions
            of African-Americans were still prevented from voting. Don began his fulltime investment career at the start
            of 1972, just before Richard Nixon flew to China to begin a relationship with Chairman Mao.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span>This is about an era during which almost all technology companies of merit were formed in the
            United States; when women, unfortunately, played a minor role in Silicon Valley; when it was very expensive
            to start a company and before Sequoia had even contemplated doing business in China or India or South-east
            Asia or forming Sequoia Heritage, Sequoia Capital Global Equities, or a Global Growth Fund (let alone RMB
            funds, Surge, AMP or Base Camp). This is a sketch of the first chapter of Sequoia, which ended in 1996, but
            without which none of us would have enjoyed all the goodness that has come our way or be doin what we now
            do. </span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">In 1986, the year I joined Sequoia (which, I&rsquo;m afraid, now makes me the longest
            serving member of our business), almost half of the people who today work in our Menlo Park office had yet
            to be born. So bear with me. Some of this may seem arcane or closer to Babylonian times than 2020. But
            beyond the portrait of Don, I hope you find some relevant nuggets because, while the scenery, the venues,
            and the cast of characters have changed, the essence of investing remains the same. I hope you also
            understand that while Don penned our first chapter, great organizations only thrive if later generations
            continue the story while having the humility to grasp that their contributions too will eventually
            fade.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><strong>THIS IS DON AND THIS IS HOW SEQUOIA BEGAN.</strong></span></p>

    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c7">WHEN I WAS trying to break into the venture business in the mid-1980s I went to meet
            the leaders of six firms.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;All, bar one, told me they did not know what to do
            with a history major and journalist who had never worked in a technology company, was poor at math and
            couldn&#39;t tell a voltage regulator from an amplifier. The exception was Don Valentine to whom I owe the
            opportunity for joining, and, eventually, helping build what is now known as Sequoia.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time I met him, Don had spent decades refining his interviewing technique. He
            was not one to put young candidates at ease. He conducted his interrogations at a small, round, wooden table
            in the corner of his large office at 3000 Sand Hill Road where the morning sun blinded anyone sitting
            opposite him and the view looked towards California&#39;s coastal range.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">My interview began in silence and with a ritual, bordering on the theatric, for Don
            had a fine sense of timing. Dressed in slacks, a button-down shirt, tie, plaid socks, and a pair of
            cordovan, tasseled penny loafers, he padded over to his desk (for yes, in those days there were generously
            proportioned private offices). His wooden desk was large and L-shaped and organized with the precision of a
            table set for a state banquet - everything neatly aligned and nothing askew: blotting pad, large desk diary,
            paper knife, small-clocks and stationary purloined from a fancy hotel that Don had visited on one of his
            golfing vacations. A LeRoy Neiman silkscreen of the Olympic ski champion twins, Phil and Steve Mahre, hung
            above the credenza on which were arranged family photographs of Rachel (his wife of 58 years) and his
            children, Mark, Christian and Hilary. The balance of the available wall space was occupied by prospectus
            covers for Tandon, Tandem, Dysan, Apple, Valid Logic, and LSI Logic. There was no computer or
            typewriter.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don retrieved a lined yellow pad from his desk and unclipped a thin ballpoint pen
            bearing the original, multi- colored Apple logo from his shirt pocket and sat down at the little round
            table. But the preliminaries had barely begun. There was then a tea ceremony since Don disliked coffee and
            was an aficionado of loose-leaf teas, all of which were stacked in an imposing wall of pale yellow cans,
            organized like an ammunition depot, in our small galley. Don placed the tea-infuser in the cup, stirred the
            water slowly, extracted the infuser, held it above the cup until it dripped dry and then placed it on a
            small, cork mat.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Several sneezes and the unfurling of a large handkerchief followed the tea
            preparation, for Don was often plagued by allergies. He ran a hand through the thick thatch of hair he
            maintained until his final breath, locked his blue eyes on me, and played his opening one syllable gambit,
            &#39;so.&#39; This was accompanied by the faint hint of a question mark. That was my introduction to
            Don.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>LIKE ALL OF US, Don was a creature of his heritage. He was born Donald Thomas
            Valentine on June 26, 1932 in Yonkers, New York, and his formative years were spent in an America that had
            just emerged from the terrifying scourge of the Great Depression only to be, after Pearl Harbor, swept into
            the cataclysm of World War II. His father, Milton, was a milkman and his mother, May Hansen, was a
            homemaker. He had one brother. Neither of his parents had graduated from grade school and his father never
            possessed a checking account, which meant that Don always paid his college tuition fees in cash. His father
            was, as Don put it, &#39;a minor functionary&#39; in the Teamsters, far removed from the graft and behavior
            of its upper echelon. Nevertheless, it was an affiliation that kindled Don&#39;s lifelong dislike for
            organized unions. From his Danish grandfather, who only spoke partial English and had fought in the
            Spanish-American war, Don learned that he should never waste any food - a lesson he came to apply to most
            things in life.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;s schooling took place in the Bronx, first with Franciscan nuns with an
            affinity for swatting miscreants on the head, then at all-boys Roman Catholic high school, the Mount Saint
            Michael Academy under the guidance of Marist brothers. He went on to study at Fordham University, where his
            professors were Jesuits and whose teaching approach was based on the restless, open-ended questioning style
            of Socrates. It was this style of inquiry, aimed at rooting out answers to intractable topics from a
            collection of people with different points of view and experiences that, more than the details of his
            studies, influenced Don throughout his life. It made him doubt everything - particularly conventional
            thinking- and was the source of some of his favorite, terse ways of ferreting out answers. &quot;Why?&quot;
            &quot;Who cares?&quot;, &#39;Who needs it?&#39; &#39;Why does it matter?&#39;, &#39;What does it do?&#39;,
            and &#39;So what?&#39; were the plain verbal thrusts he came to employ to gauge whether prices could be
            raised, a product made sense, a new market should be attacked or the significance of a milestone.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He studied chemistry at Fordham and was co-captain of the water polo team - a pursuit
            he conducted with such obsession that in later years he could scarcely tolerate the idea of putting his head
            in a swimming pool. After graduation in 1954 he was drafted and spent about a year in the army at Fort
            Monmouth and Fort George Meade instructing officers about radar systems. He was then transferred, due to his
            prowess at water polo, to a naval air base in Southern California, where he spent mornings surfing at
            Huntington Beach and afternoons training for the water-polo trials for the 1956 Olympic games. Here he also
            got his first taste of temperate winters.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the Army he joined Sylvania in 1957, which mainly supplied manufacturers of
            consumer electronics, and after that Raytheon where he got a taste for military and aerospace customers. He
            moved to Los Angeles in 1960 to join the company that came to change every aspect of his existence -
            Fairchild Semiconductor. Photographs of Don from that era show a tanned, handsome man with a crewcut who
            looked as if he had just stepped out of the astronauts&#39; training program.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When asked whether he went to business school, Don would usually answer that he did
            and, after a suitable pause, would declare, &#39;I attended Fairchild.&quot; You cannot know Don and how he
            approached small companies and venture investing, without understanding the significance of Fairchild
            Semiconductor. Now, more than sixty years after its formation in 1957, the same year the launch of Sputnik
            advertised to Americans the importance of advanced technology, it is impossible to overstate the influence
            Fairchild Semiconductor played in Don&#39;s life. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fairchild Semiconductor was California&#39;s first growing technology company. If you
            are ever inclined to think the problems we encounter today are new, examine the history of Fairchild, which
            shows us that the challenges in developing companies are the same as ever - it&#39;s just the people, the
            dates, and the numbers that are different. Fairchild Semiconductor was the first company to design and
            produce integrated silicon circuits and laid the foundation for the hundreds of billions of units that
            subsequently have made their way into computers, rockets, airplanes, pacemakers, traffic lights, phones,
            watches, washing machines, automobiles, door-bells, lightbulbs, missiles, fridges, microwaves, sprinklers,
            and every muscle, tissue, and sinew of everyday life.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Fairchild that paved the way for the decline in the cost of computing which
            made it possible for firms like Sequoia to invest in young technology companies. It was Fairchild that
            helped set the world on a path which every year has brought about a decline in the cost of computing so that
            now we don&#39;t think twice about ordering a pair of heated ski socks that can be controlled by an app. If
            you ever wondered how Sequoia came to invest in short-form video or food delivery companies in China, cancer
            detection or genetic matching companies in the United States, streaming martial arts competitions and online
            education lessons in India and Asia, online payments and curated tourism in Europe - all of these businesses
            can trace their roots to Fairchild.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">No company in the history of the industrial world has had the impact of Fairchild
            Semiconductor and, if there was an economic version of 23andMe, Fairchild would be in a class of its own -
            the progenitor of all the succeeding generations of Silicon Valley companies. Fairchild Semi-
            conductor&#39;s employees, towing their friendships, rivalries, feuds, and animosities, went on to start or
            play important management roles in dozens, if not several hundred, Silicon Valley companies and venture
            firms between the end of the 1960s and start of the 1990s.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don joined Fairchild Semiconductor because he understood from his background in
            chemistry that the silicon favored by the Fairchild engineers allowed electronic devices to operate at far
            higher temperatures than the germanium that had previously been in vogue. He joined a company whose
            financing from its parent company, Fairchild Camera and Instrument, had been organized by a 31-year-old New
            York investment banker, Arthur Rock, a man who became the only venture investor ever to appear on the cover
            of TIME.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fairchild Semiconductor was formed by a team of eight led by Bob Noyce, the inventor
            of the silicon integrated circuit, whom Don considered the smartest person he ever met. Years afterwards,
            when Don used to explain the advantage he held over others in the venture business, he used to proclaim,
            &#39;I could see the future,&#39; a gift for clairvoyance he attributed entirely to Bob Noyce who had helped
            him comprehend the role that silicon devices and, a couple of decades later microprocessors, would come to
            play.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The atmosphere Don imbibed during his seven year stay at Fairchild Semiconductor in
            the 1960s, the circumstances he encountered, the growth he witnessed, the boom he enjoyed, the collapse he
            fled, echo through every phase of Sequoia&#39;s own business and all our investments. Fairchild
            Semiconductor taught Don about the importance of large markets, technology, hiring, speed, aggression,
            frugality, outsourcing, marketing, and, as he used to say, &quot;The two things in business that matter:
            high gross margins and cash flow.&#39; It also gave him an education in how to achieve business success and
            the sort of people required to pull it off. Fairchild was profitable very quickly and grew at a rate
            hitherto unseen in Northern California. By 1961 its sales had reached $91 million - the equivalent of about
            $760 million today. Fairchild Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, and Motorola came to have such a grip on the
            semiconductor industry in the early 1960s that Bob Noyce went so far as to suggest that there would never be
            room for another semiconductor company. Don moved to Fairchild Semiconductor&#39;s Northern California
            headquarters in 1962 and became head of sales in 1964.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">If anyone thinks that hiring is taxing today, consider the note circulated in the mid
            1960s at Fairchild Semiconductor which described recruiting as, &#39;probably absorbing as much energy as
            new product development.&#39; If people wonder whether lunacy like WeWork had precedents, check out the
            warning issued by the SEC as the stock market boomed in the early 1960s, warning of the &#39;improper
            practices in the issuance and sale of space age stocks.&#39; As for the idea that manufacturing in Asia as a
            competitive advantage only became apparent in the late twentieth century, Fairchild Semiconductor began
            assembly operations in Hong Kong in 1963. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, if you ever wonder why
            large companies fail you have to look no further than Fairchild Semiconductor.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The East Coast management of Fairchild Camera and Instruments, instead of feeding the
            business needs of the thriving semiconductor division and rewarding its employees with stock options, used
            the cash generated by its west coast semiconductor division to invest in sleepier and more traditional areas
            such as graphic arts, office equipment, home movie cameras, and printing presses. When business at Fairchild
            Semiconductor started to slow in the late 1960s, competitors picked off its key employees with option
            packages and an exodus began.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Don, this experience only hardened his resolve against what he saw as the
            condescending, patronizing, hidebound ways of East Coast companies. Fairchild sowed the seeds of its own
            destruction and it was soon eclipsed by the spinoffs it spawned: National Semiconductor, the company Don
            joined in 1967; Advanced Micro Devices (whose lobby came to include a marble bust and painting of a medieval
            knight portraying likenesses of its founder, Jerry Sanders); and Intel, the most successful of the bunch
            formed in 1968 by Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fairchild Semiconductor schooled Don in what it took to develop a fast-moving, high
            growth, technology company and in the hardscrabble tactics required to compete. It also opened his eyes to
            the bitter intramural tussles between manufacturing, engineering and marketing. While at Fairchild
            Semiconductor Don, unwittingly, was given a lesson in the basics of venture investing: he had to gauge the
            relative prospects of customers to help determine which were worthy of special treatment. This required
            evaluating the markets they were attacking, the competitive merits of their products and the capabilities of
            their managements. As he gravitated towards marketing he figured out the destiny of a company fell between a
            marketing department that could figure out what customers needed and an engineering department capable of
            designing them. Don had helped build Fairchild Semiconductor&#39;s salesforce into the industry&#39;s most
            competitive, although his last official post at the company was Director of Marketing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">While Don harbored no truck for the management of the parent company, headquartered
            on Long Island, he found the character and quirks of Sherman Fairchild, its founder, irresistible. Sherman
            Fairchild&#39;s father had been the first president of IBM and had left a fortune at his death. He thus
            bequeathed to his son a fascination with technology and a taste for the high life. Fairchild started a
            business to make aerial cameras and, in the 1920s, founded an aircraft company.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">One Sherman Fairchild idiosyncrasy Don relished came from encountering his employer
            at a conference table dressed in a blazer and a shirt and tie while, out of sight beneath the table, he was
            wearing shorts and old shoes. Fairchild&#39;s explanation was that while he was sitting or attending
            cocktail parties he had observed that nobody looks below the waist. (Sequoia&#39;s Fairchild connection
            lives on via The Sherman Fairchild Foundation which has now invested in 48 separate Sequoia funds.)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don was recruited to join National Semiconductor, then a small public company, as its
            founding head of sales and marketing by Fairchild Semiconductor&#39;s former head of manufacturing, Charlie
            Sporck, who was leading a turn- around effort. When I encountered Charlie in the early 1980s he was direct
            and blunt, still driving an old pick-up truck and smoking cigars in the office. In popular lore nothing
            epitomized the frugality for which National was renowned more than the sheep that one day was employed to
            trim the fringe of lawn outside its headquarters. A Fortune story of the era labeled the team Sporck headed
            as, &quot;The Animals of Silicon Valley&#39; and declared &#39;National Semiconductor&#39;s beastly ways
            have paid off.&#39; National Semiconductor was a company with a reputation for cost-cutting, bare-bones
            pricing, and outsourcing as many activities as possible. Like Don, Charlie harbored strong views about what
            took place in Washington, &#39;I was anti-government and viewed all politicians as a bunch of
            bastards.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c7"><br></span>
        <hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;">
    </p><hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">AFTER A DECADE in the semiconductor business, Don grew restless, feeling that he had
            learned what it took to build a startup and engage in a turnaround and that, for him, there were no more
            mountains to left to conquer within the industry. At National he had started making small investments in
            young companies. Equally important, he had become acquainted with the community of stock analysts since
            Charlie Sporck had delegated investment relations to the member of the management team who had the quickest
            tongue - Don. (Go to YouTube and look at videos of Johnny Carson from the 1950s or Ronald Reagan from the
            early 1960s, to get a sense for the pace of Don&#39;s wit.)</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was during these investor sessions that Don encountered analysts from Capital
            Research and Management, then a 120-person, Los Angeles-based mutual fund company with just over $1B in
            assets (compared to $500&#1074; and 6,000 people in 2000). One of these employees, its technology
            specialist, Jim Martin, had worked for Don at Fairchild Semiconductor. A friendly, gregarious man, Jim
            helped Mike Shanahan, a senior Capital analyst, make the case to their colleagues that the best way to stay
            conversant on changes in technology would be to invest in a venture fund.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sale within Capital was contentious and protracted and some of the senior people
            mounted active opposition to the entire idea. Don joined Capital to manage its venture program in early 1972
            with the understanding that Capital would help him raise the money. Capital employees were forbidden from
            investing their clients&#39; money in the fund and could only participate by writing personal checks which,
            when pooled with the firm&#39;s own money, amounted to $1 million. At the time Don joined Capital, he was
            unaware of the &#39;Prudent Man Rule.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were profound implications of this rule for those hankering to assemble pools
            of capital to invest in young companies. It meant that the U.S. institutions that these days are the
            mainstay of the venture capital and leveraged buyout business, from giant state pension funds and corporate
            pension plans to the endowments of small colleges and hospitals, had to stay on the sidelines. A good
            portion of the small amount of money invested in the venture business during the 1960s and 1970s came from
            families such as the Rockefellers and the Whitneys or the government sponsored SBIC (Small Business
            Investment Company) program established in the late 1950s. Don never contemplated seeking money from the
            government or contending with federally employed bureaucrats.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not until 1978 that the government relaxed the rule prohibiting U.S. pension
            funds from investing in venture capital pools, meaning that Don spent almost two years cobbling together the
            first pool. It took a lot of work on the part of both Don and Capital to raise $5 million for what later
            became known as Sequoia Capital I. The Ford Foundation invested $3 million and Capital and Teijin, a
            Japanese chemical company, chipped in the balance. Don&#39;s most important fund-raising ally within Capital
            was Bob Kirby, who headed Capital Guardian Trust and who, after the 1987 stock market crash, was a member of
            the five-person team charged by President Reagan to investigate the roots of the meltdown. It was Bob Kirby,
            too, who penned the line that I have often thought should be repeated every time we contemplate a stock
            distribution at Sequoia: &#39;You can make more money being passively active than actively
            passive.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meantime, some forward-thinking investors started agitating for legislative change.
            One of the ringleaders was Roger Kennedy, VP of Finance for the Ford Foundation between 1969 and 1977, a man
            Don labeled his &#39;patron saint.&#39; (Kennedy had an unusually varied life. During the 1950s he had been
            White House correspondent for NBC and after leaving the Ford Foundation he ran the National Park Service and
            the Smithsonian.) The lobbying efforts in which Kennedy participated paid off in 1978 when the U.S. Labor
            Department allowed institutions to invest in what hitherto had been considered risky areas.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tiny venture business, which had limped through most of the 1970s, received
            another tonic in 1978 when federal tax rates on capital gains were reduced from 49.5% to 28%. The effect of
            these two booster shots was immediate. The $68 million invested in the venture business in 1977 grew to just
            under $1 billion in 1978 and about $5 billion in 1983. It was against this backdrop that Don, with Bob Kirby
            providing introductions and coaching, raised the $19 million that became Sequoia Capital II - enticing
            prospective investors with the prospect of annual net returns between 20% and 25%, at least double what they
            expected from their staple 60/40 selection of publicly traded stocks and bonds.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The limited partners in Sequoia Capital II were all Capital clients and were a bit of
            a hodge-podge: ALCOA, then the largest aluminum maker in the U.S.; Armco, a steel manufacturer; General
            Electric, a Hong Kong trading company; the Citibank Pension Fund; as well as Capital and Teijin. (The
            General Electric relationship was short-lived and some years later ended after a meeting when its CEO, Jack
            Welch, made the mistake of telling Don that he thought that cyclicality made the semiconductor industry a
            terrible place to invest.)</span></p>
            <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>THE GENERAL PARTNER ranks of the first three Sequoia funds included Capital
            Management Services (as a legal entity) but more particularly, Mike Shanahan, who was president of both of
            Capital&#39;s principal businesses, and Capital&#39;s chief financial officer, Bud MacRae. Mike had
            organized the financing of Advanced Micro Devices and remained on its board for many years. Bud, a former
            Deloitte accountant, served on the boards of several Sequoia companies. The first two funds also had a
            five-person board of directors who, with the exception of Don, were all long-serving Capital
            employees.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the second fund was raised, Don recruited a former Fairchild Semiconductor
            salesman, Gordon Russell, to help him. After leaving Fairchild, Gordy had entered the healthcare business
            and had been the general manager of the Analytical Instrument Division of Syntex, best known for marketing
            an early birth control pill. Gordy had also managed the medical division of Coherent Radiation.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don wanted Gordy to help Sequoia start investing in medical device and instrument
            companies which incorporated increasing amounts of electronic technology.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The most significant addition to Sequoia was Pierre Lamond. Born in Paris in 1930,
            Pierre spoke English by the age of nine and developed an early interest in the electronics of radios through
            listening to Radio France Libre broadcasts from London during World War II. Pierre, who found the war
            painful to discuss for understandable reasons, survived the Nazi occupation of France partly by finding
            refuge in Italy. He first heard of the invention of the transistor in 1948 while still at high school. He
            studied engineering at university in Toulouse, a discipline viewed half-heartedly by the prestigious
            Parisian Polytechniques. After graduation Pierre was drafted and spent three years in the French army (an
            experience that taught him &#39;not to volunteer for anything&quot;) where he translated for high-ranking
            officers at NATO headquarters (then located just outside Paris) and used his spare time to advance his
            knowledge of the physics of transistors.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In 1957, unable to find a semiconductor company in France, Pierre joined Transitron,
            a Boston company that during the opening chapter of the chip business was a match for Fairchild and Texas
            Instruments. At first he ran a production line, consisting largely of the wives of Portuguese fishermen, and
            quickly thereafter ran most of the company&#39;s development group because of his knowledge of transistor
            technology. In 1961, convinced that Transitron&#39;s founder was making the wrong technical choices, Pierre
            resigned and joined Fairchild. There he worked directly for Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, starting in
            development before running production. Among the people who reported to Pierre was Andy Grove, who attended
            the classes Pierre gave on transistor electronics to all new recruits. Grove joined Intel on the day of its
            formation and he subsequently helped build it into the most important semiconductor company in the
            world.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As frustration with the ham-fisted approach of its parent company mounted at
            Fairchild Semiconductor, Pierre began recruiting several of its most important managers to defect to
            National. Once at National, Pierre became Charlie Sporck&#39;s second-in-command and it was there that he
            burnished his reputation for an unsparing management style. (Pierre once fired a man he caught reading a
            newspaper on one of National&#39;s loading docks only to learn that he actually worked for the phone
            company.) Under Pierre&#39;s leadership, National&#39;s manufacturing prowess became the most efficient in
            the chip industry and he was one of the first to see the potential in automated testing equipment. He was a
            man for whom immediate was never soon enough and he took pride when he heard that the nickname applied to
            one of the more forbidding buildings erected for National was &#39;Fort Lamond.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pierre left National during the 1970s to run Coherent Radiation, a laser company, and
            Advent, a consumer electronics company, but eventually returned to the fold. By the early 1980s he had left
            for good, irritated by Sporck&#39;s decision, which was aided and abetted by Floyd Kvamme (who later joined
            Kleiner Perkins), to diversify into computers, cash registers, and even video games. Pierre then began
            consulting for a variety of clients including Digital Equipment, Gould, and Don Valentine. When Don formed
            the third Sequoia partnership he invited Pierre to join as a Special Limited Partner.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don and Pierre were a study in opposites. By inclination Pierre was more liberal, ran
            daily, preferred tennis to golf and developed one of the best art collections on the West Coast. (Later in
            life, he was captured in a portrait titled &#39;Man in a White Shirt&#39; by Lucian Freud, the greatest
            figurative painter of the second half of the twentieth century.) Whereas Don liked to spend the December
            holiday break skiing, Pierre invariably headed for Hawaii. Don was every technical support person&#39;s
            nightmare client, while Pierre was quite content to do his own trouble-shooting. (It was characteristic of
            Pierre to show up at a partners meeting one day with a new Apple Newton. It was just as characteristic of
            Don some weeks later, noticing that Pierre had reverted to pen and paper, to needle him by enquiring about
            the whereabouts of the Newton.) Don was quite comfortable in the limelight, saying &#39;No one has ever
            accused me of underestimating myself,&#39; while Pierre, who preferred not to draw attention to himself, was
            quite content playing second fiddle. Don preferred to delegate, Pierre liked his hands on the steering wheel
            - often phoning companies at 8:00 AM to see whether its leaders were at work.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">While Don channeled his own formative influences, Pierre contained strains of his
            countrymen Fourier and Robespierre. Don would brood silently, was rarely, if ever, profane, and operated -
            unless matters were grave - with an open office door. Pierre, who occupied an adjoining office, was more of
            a firecracker and preferred his door closed.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Behind this door, since Pierre disapproved of Don&#39;s interior decorating skills,
            were an elegant oval table, Eames chairs, and a pair of black-and-white, abstract paintings by Robert
            Motherwell. Pierre was always immaculately attired, believing that to be well-dressed was &#39;a competitive
            advantage,&#39; and whenever Don appeared in one of his more garish outfits, Pierre would announce, &#39;I
            see you got dressed in the dark.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">One due diligence trip the three of us took highlighted the contrasts in their
            personalities. After visiting Prisma, a computer company in Colorado Springs, our return flight was rerouted
            to stop in San Jose prior to arriving in San Francisco. True to form, Pierre, judging it would be quicker,
            got off the plane in San Jose to take a taxi to SFO to retrieve his car. Don, by contrast, chose to continue
            his nap and stayed on the plane until it reached its destination. The following morning Pierre was delighted
            to learn that he had got home before Don.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As investors, Don and Pierre reflected their circum- stances. Don was drawn to
            companies addressing large markets and, though he admired idiosyncratic engineers, was not particularly
            interested in understanding the technical particulars. Pierre, on the other hand, liked deeply technical
            undertakings and was less comfortable investing where, at the outset, he did not detect a pronounced
            technology advantage. At one point, while we were trying to invest in biotech companies, both Don and Pierre
            attended weekly evening classes at Stanford. At the end of the class it was Pierre, not Don, who would
            linger behind to grill the professor about an obscure detail of the lecture.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Pierre who became the active tutor for the four people who have since played
            leadership roles for Sequoia in the private markets business in the United States - Doug, Roelof, Jim (on
            whose startup board he sat), and myself. That was fine with Don since his own training program consisted of
            seeing whether people could swim in the deep-end of the pool. He would say to newcomers, &#39;You can attend
            partners meeting, but we don&#39;t want to hear you unless we ask you a question.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">
        <hr>
        <br>DON COULD BE a man of great charm. He was a ready conversationalist, had a gift
            for small talk, was invariably curious, quickly settled on topics of mutual interest, and, as a result,
            could quickly put people at their ease. He made the rounds of large social gatherings with fluid grace and
            took great pleasure in rolling out his 1950s Bentley to provide chauffeuring services at the weddings of
            friends&#39; children. The regalia in which he dressed for these events - or for Christmas parties or St
            Patrick&#39;s Day - was chosen for effect and almost always featured a plaid or a tartan and, sometimes,
            velvet slippers.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don was a nonconformist with a rebellious streak. He detested regimentation and
            disliked being organized by others, telling an assistant on one occasion, &#39;I do not want to be
            mothered.&#39; He was not a man who courted popularity or much cared about what others thought of him.
            Beyond a golf club, artistic organization, or Stanford, he took satisfaction in not being considered part of
            a group, hence his refusal to ever countenance the idea that Sequoia should join the National Venture
            Capital Association, which struck him as dangerously close to a trade union. He was no fan of policies or
            procedures since he was convinced that they stifled creativity and were promulgated by mediocrities. He
            didn&#39;t wear a watch because there was always someone else who knew the time. Since he disliked raising
            the blinds in his office and the cleaners always lowered them in the evening, he just severed the cords. At
            functions he wore his nametag on his right breast because the convention was to wear it over the left.
            &#39;It&#39;s disobedience that gets you innovation,&#39; he would say.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a devotee of the writings of Ayn Rand, the author of a pair of novels, The
            Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, that gained a devoted following of conservatives and libertarians during
            the 1940s and 1960s. Rand rejected faith and religion in favor of fact and reason and was an ardent
            supporter of energetic capitalism. (Don signaled his attachment to these ideas by making Ayn his
            daughter&#39;s middle name and later supporting the Ayn Rand Foundation.) Don was a believer in the economic
            theories of creative destruction advanced by Joseph Schumpeter, and was a &#39;small c&#39; conservative who
            identified himself as a Libertarian. He viewed government with suspicion and sometimes traced the beginning
            of America&#39;s troubles to the passage of the G.I. Bill. The only politician he openly admired was Lee
            Kuan Yew, the founder of modern Singapore, yet despite his feelings, he made occasional contributions to
            Republican candidates.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">By nature, Don was a pessimist and I never quite under- stood why, particularly since
            he was such a gifted and resilient salesman. He tended to deflect any probing on the</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">topic often attributing it to the fact that he had been given the middle name,
            Thomas, after the doubting saint. He once excused his disposition by explaining, &#39;It would be easy to be
            optimistic if we could manage to have an earthquake on a couple of the main streets of Washington DC.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perhaps it was his upbringing, perhaps it was watching the old-style companies of the
            1950s wither, perhaps it was the turmoil that ruined Fairchild and later National Semiconductor, or perhaps
            it was the dramas and struggles that plague and in many cases destroy young venture-backed companies. But,
            for whatever reason, Don was not prone to imagine what might be possible if everything went right. His
            expectations of success were always low.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don was a spartan. Beyond houses he was not a man to splurge. He often highlighted
            the gulf separating &#39;need&#39; from &#39;want.&#39; The Mercedes sports car he bought in 1988, adorned
            with the license tag, TAIPANV, (a tribute to his affection for the James Clavell novel about the founding of
            Hong Kong and the ruler of the most powerful trading company in the Far East), lasted him for the rest of
            his life.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some reason he considered semi-colons and paren- theses pretentious, broke out in
            hives when a management ever contemplated the construction of a &#39;campus,&#39; saved paper-clips, was
            wary about subscribing for a second copy of The Wall Street Journal, and banned filing cabinets because he
            thought the amount of energy spent storing and retrieving documents was a colossal waste of time. He
            relished the shock value he extracted from a meeting with the principals of Burr, Egan, Deleage &amp;
            Company, who, seeking advice about how to establish and organize their business, asked him how much room
            they should dedicate to filing cabinets. His answer: zero. Don took refuge in the idea that if a document
            was important, someone else would have a copy. He was a big fan of the way Cisco&#39;s CEO, John Morgridge,
            described at an all-hands meeting how he always traveled first class - by sitting in a row in economy with
            an eyeshade over his brow and pretending to enjoy the amenities of a more expensive cabin.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In business settings Don could be withering. &#39;I almost never have trouble with
            smart people,&#39; he once said, &#39;but I have a lot of trouble with dumb people.&#39; He felt the same
            about many people in the venture business and proclaimed, &#39;Not all venture capitalists are smart - a lot
            of them are pretty dumb.&#39; Although his excitement about an investment would always be difficult to
            discern, heavy sighs during a presentation signaled his displeasure. Some of these encounters backfired,
            especially with Jim Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics and later Netscape, who took great pleasure in
            recounting in large public gatherings what it took to be on the wrong end of a meeting with Don. Woe betide
            the company that missed plan or ran out of money prematurely. There was more than one meeting with a company
            management where Don announced, &#39;I want my money back.&#39; Don did not limit his criticism to within
            Sequoia. If you attended a Memorial Service with him it was like accompanying the theater critic of The New
            York Times. Sometimes it seemed that his tongue was his toughest muscle.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don was not inclined to extend pardons. An investment banking semiconductor analyst,
            assigned to provide coverage for Sierra Semiconductor, discovered this the hard way after he moved to
            another bank on the eve of Sierra&#39;s IPO. Some time later he visited Don to enquire whether he could
            wheedle back into his good graces. Don&#39;s response, &#39;Do you believe in reincarnation?&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don was quick to puncture pomposity and grandstanding. As part of a trip to China
            organized by Silicon Valley Bank, Don was a member of a delegation that was presented to senior members of
            the Communist Party. During the meeting, a man with political connections in the United States conveyed, in
            a long-winded manner, the greetings of some high-ranking politicians. It took Don to say what everyone else
            was thinking when he announced in a stage whisper, &#39;Someone tell that blowhard to shut up.&#39; On
            another occasion, when a lawyer who was to take his deposition extended his hand in greeting, Don replied,
            &#39;Why should I shake hands with the enemy.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oddly for someone who did not shy away from confrontation in a group setting, Don did
            not like to deal with one-on-one conflicts. These he subcontracted. Before he stepped back from Sequoia, he
            had shied away from giving the organizational tree a firm shake. Don, to his eternal credit, was gracious
            enough to acknowledge his unwillingness to tackle the issue.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don kept his emotions under lock and key. His encour- agement was indirect. He was
            not a back-slapper. He did not send notes that said &#39;Awesome&#39;, &#39;Great Work&#39;,
            &#39;Congrats&#39; or &#39;Good Stuff.&#39; He meted out expressions of gratitude and praise with an
            eye-dropper and two of the more powerful words in the English language, &#39;Well done,&#39; rarely left his
            lips. After we orchestrated an event celebrating his 75th birthday he reached for the scriptures saying,
            &#39;Remember vengeance is mine, I will repay.&#39; He was more inclined to attribute the success of others
            to luck or fortune rather than judgment and leadership. When, in the mid 1990s, Doug helped ensure Sequoia
            notched up its second $100 million gain (with a 53x multiple) with Arbor Software, Don voiced doubts about
            the company&#39;s long-term prospects. When I tried explaining why the internet advertising market would
            dwarf Cisco&#39;s, he was skeptical.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">No matter the circumstances, Don&#39;s lightning quick wit made him highly amusing
            company. Once I told him there was good news buried in a report about a software company with which I was
            helping. His retort, &#39;Did the president quit?&#39; During one company presentation a founder
            accidentally fired a binder clip at Don who responded with a broad grin, &#39;Don&#39;t you know it
            isn&#39;t a good idea to hit the source of capital.&#39; Another time someone blurted out, &quot;There is no
            confessional large enough to house my sins.&#39; Don&#39;s immediate riposte, &quot;Try St.
            Peters.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">WHEN I INTERVIEWED with Don, I asked three questions that I have subsequently been
            asked by countless candidates. &#39;What does it take to succeed in the venture business?&#39;; &#39;What
            does it take to succeed here?&#39;; and &#39;When will I know I have succeeded?&#39; He readily admitted
            that he did not know what it took to succeed in the venture business and was much more open than his peers
            towards people who appeared to have implausible backgrounds for the venture business. He was certain that
            the conventional view was wrong</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">-how else could he account for the success of characters as diverse as: Arthur Rock,
            the former investment banker without a technical background who had defied the crippling handicap of a
            Harvard Business School degree, and had arranged the financing for Fairchild Semiconductor and subsequently
            Teledyne, Intel and Apple; Tommy Davis, a former vice president of the Kern County Land Company, who had
            helped form The Mayfield Fund; Pitch Johnson, who had worked in a Midwest steel mill before starting Asset
            Management; or Reid Dennis who had worked within the Fireman&#39;s Fund pension department before forming
            IVP. For Don, the most important attributes of a venture investor were the power of observation, a lively
            imagination and a good dose of creativity. (To which I would add raw hunger and street smarts.) Don had a
            much easier time answering the other two questions. He said the road to success at Sequoia would be
            determined by two things: &#39;chemistry&#39; and &#39;when we trust you.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Don offered me a job, I asked him about compensation. His response was,
            &#39;How much are you going to pay me to work here?&#39; Fortunately, I did start to receive paychecks and
            came to occupy an office previously inhabited by Sequoia&#39;s very first associate, who had not lasted
            long. Among the many things I did not know in 1985 was that Don was not seeking what the leaders of other
            firms sought. He had seen plenty of people deeply versed in the intricacies of an arcane technology, who
            were incapable of expressing themselves clearly, let alone tell a story. He knew these types would not
            flourish at Sequoia. He did not like pontificators or poseurs, people who were full of themselves or thought
            they had many of the answers, particularly those who made the cardinal error of pretending to know something
            about which they didn&#39;t have a clue. &quot;There is nothing wrong,&#39; he would remark, &#39;in saying
            &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; In his mind, this ruled out consultants, business school graduates, lawyers,
            investmen bankers, anyone with an HR background, people with hyphenated names or roman numerals after their
            last name, direct descendants of immigrants who arrived on The Mayflower, people who had enjoyed living on
            the East Coast, and those who wore Herm&egrave;s ties, suspenders, cuff-links, signet rings, and monogrammed
            shirts. Unknown to me at the time was Don&#39;s habit of counting the number of times a candidate used
            &#39;I&#39; as opposed to &#39;we.&#39; Candidates who favored the first person were dead on
            departure.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I joined Sequoia the investment phase of the third fund, a $45 M partnership,
            had just concluded. Our total headcount was ten, of whom five were assistants. (There were also a couple of
            part-time, retired executives who ghosted in and out.) Business plans were either dropped off at the front
            door or arrived in the mail. There were no computers, printers or fax machines although we did have a xerox
            copier and five IBM Selectric typewriters. There was no e-mail, no voicemail, no text-messaging, no video-
            conferencing and - thankfully - no PowerPoint. Our telephones had been made, supplied and distributed by
            AT&amp;T and if we were out, or on a call, a message would be jotted down on a pink slip of paper and tucked
            into a plastic organizer at the front-desk. Appointments were entered by hand on paper calendars. Telephone
            numbers were kept in cards on spiral rolodexes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our paychecks, healthcare benefits and business expenses were all administered from
            the Capital Group&#39;s offices on South Hope Street in Los Angeles. We had no chief financial officer,
            accountant, book-keeper or lawyer - for Don had outsourced all financial administration to the Capital and
            all legal matters to Wilson Sonsini. No surprise, that in 1985 the nameplate on the front door still read
            Capital Management Services and Don often chuckled at the idea that until the early 1990s Capital was still
            footing Sequoia&#39;s telephone bill.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the late 1970s and early 1980s the venture business operated at a pace which even
            the French, with their allegiance to the 35-hour workweek, would have been able to maintain. For Don,
            mornings started at 9.30 am, most workdays finished around 5.00 or 5.30 pm and dinner and breakfast meetings
            were rare. Sometimes Don would take off for a dinner prior to a performance by the San Francisco Symphony or
            San Francisco Opera, but he liked being home early for a 6 pm dinner with his family and, when his children
            were young, would be a faithful attendee at all their athletic and school events. Don&#39;s daughter Hilary
            loves to tell the tale of her father&#39;s brief attempt to coach girls&#39; soccer which ended in tears
            after a hardening drill, during which he and his two sons peppered soccer balls at their young charges who
            were lined up against a wall.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The exception was Friday when he would appear earlier and, dressed in slacks, sweater
            and polo shirt, would leave by mid-morning for a golf outing. Often Rachel would pull up in a butter-colored
            Mercedes station wagon and Don would plop himself down in the passenger seat, pluck some business plans and
            a copy of Business Week from the brown leather Hartman briefcase which accompanied him everywhere, and the
            pair would head to Carmel and their weekend home, which was conveniently located close to two</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">of America&#39;s great golf courses, Pebble Beach and Spyglass.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Monday, the day reserved for partners meetings, was the only time lunch was ordered
            for everyone from The Sundeck, the small restaurant in the middle of the four office buildings at 3000 Sand
            Hill Road, which by the early 1980s had become known as the roosting place for venture capital firms. By the
            time I joined Sequoia, Don was paying close attention to his weight and diet. He did not smoke (both his
            parents having died of lung cancer) and would stage a theatrical coughing fit if he encountered cigarette
            fumes. The one exception to this regime was red wine and he had a fondness for expensive burgundies -
            particularly those paid for by investment banks as part of post IPO festivities. For lunch he would make do
            with a cup of soup and half a sandwich. During the rest of the week Don would have lunch at The Sundeck
            where he always ordered an Arnold Palmer and where Tom Ford, a former Stanford University lawyer who turned
            to real estate and, among other developments, had created what became known as &quot;Three Thousand&#39;
            would keep a close eye on everyone.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each of us had a private office with Don maintaining what had long been coveted
            during the era of &#39;Mad Men&#39; - the corner office. A small bookcase outside my office housed about
            thirty brown plastic binders, each of which related to a particular portfolio company. The binder would
            usually contain a copy of the original business plan and financial reports. Some of them also included a
            green, hard-covered lab notebooks in which handwritten notes of board meetings were entered.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">IN THE EARLY to mid 1980s and through much of the 1990s the undisputed leader of the
            venture business was Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers which, in the 1970s, had built its reputation by
            spawning from within its offices both Tandem Computers and Genentech, later adding to its luster investments
            in Compaq Computer, Lotus Development, Silicon Graphics, MIPS, America Online, Intuit and Sun Microsystems.
            For a period in the 1980s and early 1990s, KPCB, founded by Tom Perkins (who had run Hewlett Packard&#39;s
            computer business) and Gene Kleiner (one of the eight engineers who had helped found Fairchild
            Semiconductor) could not set a foot wrong.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins operated with a different approach, but in a
            spectacularly successful fashion, from behind smoked glass windows in an expensive, designer office high up
            in San Francisco&#39;s Embarcadero Center. There Tom Perkins, usually dressed in a tailored suit and smoking
            Cuban cigars, received visitors in an office decorated with models of the super-charged Bugattis that he
            collected (and maintained in a large garage staffed with mechanics in Corte Madera) and of the classic
            sailing yachts he had begun to restore. When Tom wanted to impress local CEOs and people within the
            firm&#39;s orbit, he stumped up large speaking fees for people like Henry Kissinger, while we staged our own
            versions at a local bar watching Monday Night football. (Don was no fan of anniversary events, which he
            always felt were vanity exercises only of interest to the celebrants.)</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don was leery about hiring industry executives with name recognition and large
            reputations who by the time they gravitated to the venture industry had been too successful, had lost some
            spring in their step, were not hungry enough, had too many outside commitments and, most of all, were not
            prepared to become rookies again. (Fortunately, the founders and industry executives who have come to work
            at Sequoia have been cut from a different cloth and have a sense of humility.) For the most part, Sequoia
            has flourished by nurturing the unknown, the homegrown, and what becomes the next generation. Don, knew,
            even if he didn&#39;t express the sentiment very often, that consistency, stability, longevity and mutual
            trust are a partnership&#39;s greatest allies, whereas personal vanity, greed, a quest for individual
            supremacy, the need to traffic around A-Listers and the sense that a partnership should revolve around the
            whims and needs of an individual, are not the fodder of which enduring partnerships are made. Don recognized
            that there were plenty of others who had made contributions to Sequoia and that meeting the needs of others
            was a test of leadership. While there would be occasional national press coverage of Silicon Valley in the
            mid 1980s, the media and political classes still considered America&#39;s industrial and financial might to
            reside east of the Mississippi. The major newspapers had one or two reporters in San Francisco but, prior to
            the rise of the magazines covering the personal computer, it was only The San Jose Mercury News and the
            trade publication, Electronic News, that paid much attention to the companies between Palo Alto and
            Milpitas. There were no bloggers or tweeters and neither were there more than a handful of seed funds (which
            in those days occupied a precarious position) or the class of solo capitalists (so artfully- and
            misleadingly -labeled &#39;angels&#39;) let alone the hundreds, if not thousands, of people writing $25,000
            or $50,000 checks.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">While competition between firms was stiff there were often Monday lunches where one
            set of partners would troop off to have lunch at another firm. Don would always make some remark about the
            price being right when we lunched elsewhere. Every month or so most of the venture community would have clan
            lunches at Quadrus on Sand Hill Road, organized by WAVC (Western Association of Venture Capitalists), where
            guest speakers were bill-boarded.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once or twice a year the American Electronics Association (AEA) would stage a two or
            three day conference in a hotel overlooking the freeway in Monterey, where dozens of small companies seeking
            money would meet with venture investors. These used to be twenty or thirty minute meetings followed up by
            one-on-one meetings and these encounters sometimes led to investments.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For everyone in the venture business the apogee was the Stanford Business
            School&#39;s Company of the Year Award - which was about as close to an Oscar ceremony as we local venture
            capital firms were capable of staging. It was started in 1979 and still exists, although it now seems like a
            throw- back to bygone times. For about twenty-five years the event involved much behind-the-scenes jockeying
            and lobbying. It was as close as the venture community could get to staging an Oscar ceremony except ours
            involved no gold</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">statuette, had little or no media coverage, and took place in a jam-packed room with
            a bad audio system overlooking the polo field at Atherton&#39;s pristine Menlo Circus Club. The prize-winner
            was always introduced by its main Iventure backer and we kept close tabs on which venture firm claimed
            bragging rights and had accumulated the</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">most winners.</span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br><br>AT SEQUOIA, partners meetings and presentations were conducted in the only
            one of our two conference rooms capable of housing more than four people. This was decorated, like the other
            walls around the office, with copies of posters framed, paid for and supplied by the more notable portfolio
            companies and some exquisite layouts of chip design fine enough to pass as abstract art. At one end of the
            room there was a blackboard and a pull-down screen. Most presentations consisted of &#39;foils&#39; -
            acetate slides that were placed atop an overhead projector, frequently upside down and often blown to the
            floor by an errant fan. Occasionally, when a company wanted to put on a real show, the CEO would bring a
            carousel of 35 mm slides which were installed on a Kodak projector often prompting Don to declare with glee,
            &#39;Ah, we get to go to the movies!&#39; Since Don was a believer in lean inventory there were more than a
            few occasions when, after the projector bulb blew out, the CEO was forced to fall back on improvisational
            skills.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don was a fan of brevity and precision and a practitioner of realpolitik. The notes
            he made in meetings were brief and often hilarious - all jotted down in printed letters, a fact he</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">attributed to being forced by nuns to write with his right hand rather than the left
            hand he favored. &#39;Franciscan nuns were very adept at beating,&#39; he&#39;d say. His critiques of
            presentations could have closed Broadway shows in a couple of days. A favorite one-liner for a long-winded
            presentation, which he lifted from a scene in the movie Amadeus was, &quot;There were too many notes.&#39;
            On one occasion, exasperated by one circumlocutory explanation, Don extracted a business card from his
            folder, slid it across the table, informed the CEO that all of us would leave the room for a few minutes and
            when we returned he hoped that the company&#39;s business plan would be written on the back of the
            card.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the start of a partners meeting, Don went around the room and compiled the agenda
            (much as we still do today in Menlo Park, albeit in a more automated manner). Don took pains never to speak
            first and almost always spoke last. He was very aware of what would happen if he voiced his opinion before
            others and went to great lengths not to influence the jury. Instead he wanted to hear from everyone and,
            because he was such a skilled poker player, it was usually difficult to discern whether he agreed or
            disagreed with the sentiments that were expressed. This helped foster the sort of debates about investments
            that a foreign service officer might characterize as a &#39;frank and candid exchange of views.&#39; After a
            younger member recruit had begun to display some mettle, he would begin to invite them to weigh in and let
            them either hang or distinguish themselves. There were moments of hilarity during partners&#39; meetings but
            for the most part they were serious affairs - particularly when matters were going awry at a company.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don was not a micromanager. He was comfortable letting others take the floor and was not one of those people who suffocate the
            initiative of others. He liked to keep things simple and didn&#39;t believe people were capable of
            remembering more than two or three goals. He kept the same approach with portfolio companies saying,
            &quot;The CEO who runs a good board meeting, runs a good company.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;s favorite form of communication was a handwritten note penned in green ink.
            When Electronic Arts had fallen behind plan and its burn rate had climbed, Don took the company&#39;s most
            recent balance sheet, circled the entry for the cash balance, and wrote in the margin &#39;6 months of cash
            left.&quot; This he then mailed to Trip Hawkins, Electronic Arts&#39; CEO. Inside Sequoia he employed the
            same method of commu- nication. When we were slow to recognize the advent of the internet, he circulated a
            Business Week article celebrating the dawn of Netscape, underlined the salient points in green ink and
            provided the goad we needed to systematically beat the bushes and eventually find Yahoo!.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Not everyone knew the source of these handwritten notes. At one Cisco board meeting,
            the company&#39;s VP of sales, Terry Eger, noticed that Don was unhappy and asked him why. &#39;He
            said,&#39; Eger recalled, &#39;you never do anything I ask you to do.&#39; I noticed he was writing in green
            ink. I then said, &#39;You&#39;re the one who has been sending me the notes in green ink. I have been
            crumbling them up and throwing them away. You have to sign your name!&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Green was also the color Don chose to represent Sequoia and, for the longest time,
            our green logo was supposed to represent the leaf of a Sequoia tree. There were many people</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">who mistook it for a marijuana leaf, including U.S. Customs, which once subjected
            Don&#39;s airplane (whose tail was adorned with Sequoia&#39;s emblem) to lengthy inspection on a return trip
            from Mexico. When a designer was asked to come up with Sequoia&#39;s first brochure, he asked Don what color
            scheme would be preferred. Don whipped out a one-dollar note which he held up with both hands and said,
            &#39;green.&#39; Don&#39;s devotion to green was recognized at one Sequoia function where he was presented
            with a five-foot high green Crayola pencil that thereafter stood in the corner of his office. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">One other aspect of Don&#39;s management approach merits mention. He was a martinet
            when it came to maintaining discipline among clients. In the early 1980s, Don was irritated by the demeanor
            of the new head of the investment department at the Ford Foundation and, as a result, they were dropped from
            the third partnership. (Happily the Ford Foundation rejoined Sequoia in 1984 and have been a bulwark ever
            since.) Don&#39;s favorite response to any limited partner who began badgering for lower fees, preferential
            returns or some other concession was to say with a stony glare, &#39;I read in the history books that
            slavery had been abolished.&#39;</span></p>
            <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br><br>THE ESSENCE OF Don&#39;s approach, both to investments and the management of
            Sequoia, has placed us in good stead to this day. He was fixated on large markets - sometimes asking how
            many large companies have been built in small markets. He relished high gross margins believing that they
            provided lots of cushion for management mistakes and, in well-run businesses, would lead to large amounts of
            free cash flow and high valuations. He did not bother himself with financial projections since he was
            convinced they might as well have been published by Marvel Comics. (In the early days he just calculated a
            company&#39;s burn rate by doubling the cost of the engineers.) As for investment results he was a fan of
            two things: large amounts of gain and very high multiples. Though he understood the personal benefits, he
            thought any goon with a spreadsheet could double a large amount of money but believed it took real talent to
            consistently deliver high multiples of money. The shenanigans of the leveraged buyout business with all its
            financial hokey-pokey left him cold.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He would clamp onto burn rates and the line in the income statement that he would
            always circle in green would be G&amp;A, which nowadays seems ironic given how crucial a role many people
            working in these functions have for Sequoia. Like Larry Ellison, he believed that anything not closely
            associated with either directly making, building, marketing or selling a product was a waste of money. He
            would latch onto any function or person in a company whom he felt impeded the rapid advance of the business
            or devised rules and processes he found irksome. He reserved special scorn for HR, saying, &quot;The last
            person you want to hire in a startup is an HR person. They are the destroyers of companies. They&#39;re the
            ones that write the binders and tell you what the rules are and how much everybody gets in grade seven.&#39;
            He reserved a special place for lawyers, &#39;I&#39;d have them nailed up in the lobby.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the time he was leading Sequoia, Don rightly saw no need to wander beyond the
            parish since he was of the mind that, gold had been discovered twice in California - first in the foothills
            and later in Mountain View. The parish, in his view was, &#39;the four-oh-eight area code&#39; and he would
            say that he liked to be able to cycle to companies where he was involved. This was partly because all our
            contacts were around Silicon Valley and partly because Don believed that, &#39;when you go east past Denver
            you go into a technical oblivion.&#39; Travel, save for the odd trip to Southern California or Seattle or,
            on occasion, Colorado (which housed a cluster of storage companies and where we always lost money), was
            saved for vacations. Our international strategy consisted of the occasional drive across the Dumbarton
            Bridge to Alameda County.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don had no sympathy for investment crusades or what others held in vogue. Just
            because biotech investments held the promise of better health for millions did not mean biotech startups
            would make for good investments. Later, when some of our competitors went berserk with Greentech
            investments, Don rolled his eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don jealously guarded the way he spent his time and the effort involved with
            portfolio companies saying, &#39;time is only invested where the return prospects do not require candles and
            prayers.&#39; He took a dim view of people who confused travel with work. When, in the mid-1980s, we were
            trying to land MIT as a client, Don did not travel to Cambridge, MA. He left that to Gordon Russell, who
            paid homage at the MIT investment office every time he returned to Boston to visit relatives.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike today&#39;s portfolio reviews, our investment analysis in earlier days was
            largely a one-man affair. These would occur after Don had been on a long plane journey returning</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Following from his annual golfing migration to Scotland or the December break.
            Whether it was summer or winter, his assessments were always so dire that, before I became accustomed to
            them, I was convinced that we would all soon be living on Bleak Street.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Sequoia&#39;s first growth equity fund was raised in 1987 Don was forced,
            reluctantly, into holding limited partners meetings which, compared to our current Cirque du Soleil
            performances, were amateur vaudeville shows. The most disastrous was held at San Francisco&#39;s St. Francis
            Drake hotel which, at the time, was undergoing renovation with a non-union workforce. The hotel was owned by
            a pal of Don&#39;s who had offered a discount rate, but it was only when we showed up during one of San
            Francisco&#39;s infrequent hot spells that we discovered all our clients would need to cross picket lines,
            pneumatic drilling would punctuate the proceedings and the air-conditioning did not work. To top it off one
            of the speakers - oblivious to his audience - overran his allotted time by thirty minutes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In retrospect, the less clinical aspects of Don&#39;s manage- ment approach were more
            important than his oversight of our investment activities. It&#39;s worth noting that Don was in charge of
            Sequoia when two women investors joined us to lead our biotech investment efforts, decades before women had
            joined other venture firms. One recently recalled, &#39;Don was always, always, kind and forthright with me.
            For many reasons I respected him, but I also liked him much. Very I often found myself absorbing the things
            that he said - just little things, sometimes about business, sometimes about people.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was also Don who was at the helm when in 1987, when we backed Network Computing
            Devices, a terminal company co-founded by Judy Estrin, the daughter of a pair of UCLA computer scientists
            who later, supported by Don, became Cisco&#39;s Chief Technology Officer. It was Don too who relished the
            spirit of both Sandy Lerner the cofounder of Cisco Systems and Carol Bartz, (another computer scientist and
            one of the Sun Microsystems&#39; management team and later CEO of Autodesk and Yahoo!) whom he recruited to
            Cisco&#39;s Board.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Justifiably, much has been made of the fact that Don chose the world&#39;s largest
            and longest living redwood as the name for our business rather than stamping his own name on the front door.
            It conveyed the longevity and strength with the realism of someone who had seen what happens when people
            want vanity billing. We were thus able to avoid a plague that has beset other firms - the inevitable
            second-class citizen status attached to anyone whose name is not on the door.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don spent a lot of time wondering why other venture firms split asunder and were torn
            to shreds by rivalries between partners and squabbles over compensation and pecking order. Don did what he
            could to avoid petty quarrels and needless squabbles within Sequoia, at one point hiring an outside
            consultant (with great effect) to help. Whenever emotions or tempers ran hot he would try to calm things by
            saying, &#39;The enemy is outside the gates. Not inside.&#39; Ego and greed were the two perils with Sequoia
            that he saw as far deadlier than anything competitors might do to us. Sometimes, during meetings with
            guests, when all eyes were focused on him, he would deflect attention by inviting others to take the floor.
            (I&#39;ve often thought that Sequoia&#39;s longevity is due to just one thing: unlike many other
            partnerships, we have refrained from killing each other.) </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">More subtly, Don saw no reason to have large differences in compensation between the
            principals who had proved their value and, after the first couple of partnerships, he made sure that he,
            Pierre and Gordon received the same rewards. He had scant regard for the heads of hedge funds who hog all
            the economics or the titans of the private equity industry who believe that the sun only rises when they get
            out of bed. He thought there was more than enough money to get spread around and saw little reason to
            heighten tensions and jealousies by having sizeable pay disparities - including between himself and others.
            He understood the absurdity of our compensation schemes and would often say we would have to be NBA
            All-Stars to do as well.</span></p>
            <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br><br>ALL COMPANIES ARE like television dramas - some are never more than a pilot
            show, others are canceled halfway through a season, a number run for a few years and only the exceptional
            last for decades. But all of them have a story and in Sequoia&#39;s case, we could fill volumes with the
            history of the many dramas in which we have been participants.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Over the course of twenty years - the period in which Don was actively involved with
            making new investments - there are many companies that bear his influence and it would be easy to relay
            accounts of many, including Valid Logic (one of the first electronic design automation companies), Tandon (a
            disk drive manufacturer), Altos (a maker of multi-user UNIX-based computers, Oracle (in which Sequoia
            purchased a secondary stake), Electronic Arts (which started in Sequoia&#39;s office in the formative era of
            the videogame business), Sierra Semiconductor (which led to the formation in Singapore of Chartered
            Semiconductor, one of the early semiconductor foundries) and NetApp (a data storage company.)</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">These earlier companies tended to have far shorter holding periods than the ones to
            which we have become accustomed in the past twenty years. Some of this was due to the absence of a growth
            equity market, some by the level of interest rates, which peaked at 20% during 1980, and, some by the
            receptivity of public market investors to small cap companies. (For example, Microsoft&#39;s and
            Oracle&#39;s valuations after their 1986 IPOs were $519 million and $188 million respectively while for
            Electronic Arts it was $74 million in 1989.) By today&#39;s standards, the amount of time between an
            investment and distribution was astonishingly short. Sequoia&#39;s $663,000 investment in Altos in December
            1980 resulted in a post-IPO $20.1 million distribution before the end of 1982. (If those returns from the
            Altos investment today seem small in absolute terms today, just multiply by ten or twenty. We do not have
            many $6 million or $12 million investments that have turned into $200 million or $400 million. In fact,
            since 1974 we have only had 42 investments with a multiple of more than 20x on invested capital.)</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Instead of trying to present an exhaustive summary of the companies with which Don
            was involved on behalf of Sequoia, I have provided capsule summaries of five with which he is closely
            associated: Atari, Apple, LSI logic, Linear Technology and, most of all, Cisco Systems.</span></p>
            <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>DON, WHO KNEW a good story when he made one, was fond of saying that Sequoia was
            put on the map by its first investment, a $150,000 wire to Atari. In reality the $600,000 invested in the
            videogame company started by Nolan Bushnell, who was one of Silicon Valley&#39;s more colorful figures in
            the 1970s and 1980s, became Sequoia&#39;s second investment. (The first investment of $150,000 was made in
            Xciton, a maker of gallium phosphide diodes, and resulted in a 64% loss of capital.) Don&#39;s due diligence
            on Atari included a trip to Andy Capp&#39;s Tavern in Sunnyvale where he saw a line of engineers standing
            outside the bar juggling quarters and waiting for the chance to play Atari&#39;s first coin-operated game,
            Pong. Don was also attracted to the idea that the stand-up game was powered by microprocessors.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;s discussions with Nolan, who had run a game arcade while at college in Utah
            and whose interest in videogames had been sparked by crude precursors played on oscilloscopes and a DEC
            minicomputer, centered on his plans for a home version of Pong because of concerns about the mafia overtones
            associated with coin-operated arcade machines. During 1975 the negotiations between Nolan and Don (who was
            representing not just Sequoia but also Mayfield, Fidelity Ventures and Time, Inc.) became so protracted that
            on the eve of the closing the Atari team had second thoughts. The Atari management had averted a cash crunch
            and when Don arrived with a case of champagne to celebrate the arrangement on behalf of Sequoia, Time Inc.,
            Mayfield and Fidelity Ventures, he was informed that the valuation would be doubled.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thereafter Don accustomed himself to Nolan&#39;s habits and the work atmosphere of
            Atari. The manufacturing area (in which the young Steve Jobs worked) reeked of marijuana smoke and board
            meetings were sometimes conducted in the hot tub at Nolan&#39;s Los Gatos home. Little more than two years
            after the Sequoia investment, Atari received a large order from Sears for the home version of Pong but the
            company was strained for capital. In those days the growth equity market was nonexistent and the Atari board
            had the choice of an IPO or sale. The public market for videogame makers had been undermined by the collapse
            of the digital watch and pocket calculator markets, and thus when Gordon Crawford of the Capital Group,
            acting as an intermediary, found a receptive audience in Steve Ross, who had turned a New York parking lot
            company into Warner Communications, the die was cast.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don took his first trip aboard a private jet when the Atari plane was sent to
            California to carry him and Nolan to New York to meet Ross. The meal that was served consisted of Kentucky
            Fried Chicken and Chateau Lafite. Barely a year after Sequoia&#39;s investment, Warner bought Atari. Several
            postscripts to this investment came later: the Atari 2600, its first home player, was introduced in 1977;
            Nolan quit Warner in 1978; Atari&#39;s disastrous foray with the videogame version of E.T. tanked the
            industry in 1984; and Nolan and Don became partners again when Sequoia financed Chuck E. Cheese&#39;s Pizza
            Time Theater, a chain of amusement centers which gained a reputation for being a place where children could safely play the latest video games and chew on inedible pizza.</span></p>
            <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">IT WAS NOLAN BUSHNELL who introduced Don to Steve Jobs. I&#39;m not going to recount
            the entire story of the origins of Apple except to say that the computer company, with the exception of the
            founders, was built in its early years by men who had spent years working at Fairchild Semiconductor and
            National Semiconductor.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don, not about to back a 19 year old with a &#39;Ho Chi Minh&#39; beard (this being
            the time of the Vietnam war) without a business plan, introduced Steve to Mike Markkula, who had worked in
            the Fairchild marketing organization before becoming wealthy as a result of being an early Intel employee.
            Mike, who unlike Don enjoyed tinkering with computers and programming, immediately saw the appeal of the
            single-board machine built by the two Steves and invested $250,000. In May 1977, shipments to 180 dealers
            began for the eleven-pound Apple II (which required a separate, small color television as a display, an
            audio cassette recorder for storage, and a printer) and by the end of September the company, which
            anticipated competition from Atari, Commodore, Texas Instruments and Tandy, had net income of $48,000 on
            sales of $756,000. The projections for fiscal 1978 were for sales of $13 million and earnings of $2 million.
            The business plan listed the benefits of what was vaguely labeled the &#39;personal, home, computer&#39;
            as:</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c7"><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">personal
            pleasure and enjoyment increased variety of entertainment</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">time saved money saved</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">better financial decisions increased leisure time</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">complete security of personal information elimination of wasted paper, energy
            and</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">storage space</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">increased personal comfort improved standard of living increased learning
            efficiency</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">increased knowledge of computers and related technology</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">protection from fire, theft and personal injury non-verbal communications
            ability</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c6">reduced pollution</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>With this sort of a laundry list it is little wonder that Don, who never thought
            many people would want to use the Apple II to balance their checkbooks or store recipes, was ambivalent
            about the future appeal of personal computers. (Mike, by contrast, wrote one of the first checkbook programs
            for the machine.) Included in the 34-page business plan was a financial forecast for 1978 which, in the era
            before Visicale, Lotus 1-2-3 and, of course, Excel, included three hand-written pages showing a monthly
            income statement, sales forecast and cash requirements.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Among the pivotal early recruits made by Mike and Steve Jobs were a president (who
            doubled as head of production) and a head of sales who had both worked at Fairchild and National. The
            finance head also attended bootcamp at National. Mike Markkula, even though chairman, also ran marketing.
            Outside marketing help was provided by Regis McKenna, who had worked for Don at National, and went on to
            build Silicon Valley&#39;s first major corporate communications business.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Apple&#39;s first-round financing, which occurred in January 1978, totaled $517,500
            and the principal investors were Venrock with $288,000, Sequoia with $150,000 and Arthur Rock with $57,600.
            Don joined the Apple Board along with Arthur, Peter Crisp from Venrock and, later, Henry Singleton, who over
            three decades built Teledyne (also backed by Arthur Rock) into one of America&#39;s great technology fueled
            conglomerates.</span></p>
            <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>DON ADMITTED THAT, in retrospect, the only investment he ever knew would be a
            certain success was Linear Technology, which was an analog semiconductor company started by a team of
            designers from National Semiconductor. Don did not employ the word &#39;genius&#39; lightly, but it was what
            he used to refer to Bob Widlar, the principal designer at Linear, a man about whom there are any number of
            colorful stories, who fought alcoholism all his life and died at the age of 53.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other person convinced that Linear would be a success was Pierre Lamond, who
            volunteered himself as Linear&#39;s CEO to Bob Swanson, its principal founder, who, like Pierre, had also
            worked at Transitron and Fairchild Semiconductor. But Bob, then 42, had worked for Pierre for many years and
            wanted his own shot. Linear, in a $5 million round designed by Don, was financed million by Kleiner Perkins,
            Hambrecht &amp; Quist, Mayfield and Sequoia. The founders were required to invest $500,000. While Don was
            the ringleader, he was careful not join the board for fear of retaliation from Charlie Sporck and National.
            It did not matter because the management of Linear spent seven years fighting off legal challenges from
            their previous employer.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bob managed Linear in a manner foreign to most startups (one of the closer
            contemporary equivalents in management approach might be Supercell, the Finnish video game maker). He
            preferred to keep engineering hiring limited to the best designers rather than water down the quality of his
            engineering ranks and refused to chase volume, instead concentrating on pursuing proprietary designs which
            would have long lifecycles and command high margins. Some Linear products enjoyed lifecycles of more than
            twenty years. It was an approach that worked spectacularly well with Linear&#39;s after tax margin running
            at 35%. The company went public in 1986 and Bob remained intimately involved until its acquisition by Analog
            Devices for $15 billion in 2017 at which point, thirty-seven years after its formation, he was executive
            chairman.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">WILF CORRIGAN, the hard-boiled son of a Liverpool dockworker, spent his life in the
            chip business. He worked at Transitron and, for many years, Motorola before become CEO of a limping
            Fairchild some years before its 1979 sale to Schlumberger. After selling Fairchild, Wilf saw an oppor-
            tunity to design fast turnaround custom semiconductors (ASICS) using proprietary design software while
            taking advantage of excess manufacturing capacity to save the expense of building a factory. (This idea
            helped lead to the creation of the custom foundry business developed by TSMC and Chartered Semiconductor.)
            Wilf formed LSI Logic in 1980 and purposefully polished his pitch with people in Europe, Japan and the East
            Coast before heading to Sand Hill Road and, eventually, Don.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For Don, part of the attraction of LSI Logic was that Wilf, who was 42, could not
            afford another failure since his outing at Fairchild had stained what hitherto had been a notable career.
            The $6M first round, anchored by Sequoia with $600,000, bought 60% of LSI Logic with Wilf investing $500,000
            - his entire liquid net worth. Both Don and Tom Perkins joined the board.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wilf chose not to wait long before raising a second round and asked for a 10x step-up
            in valuation which was met with a cold reception by both his principal investors. Don told Wilf that if he
            could raise money at that valuation, he would pay to have a statue erected in his honor. Tom added that he
            would pay to gold-plate the statue. Fortunately for Wilf, he had a chance encounter at an AEA meeting in
            Monterey with Arthur Trueger (who, starting with LSI, built a business raising capital from European sources
            to fuel the growth stages of some of Silicon Valley&#39;s best companies). When Wilf, with Arthur&#39;s
            help, returned from Europe and had raised money at an 8x step up over the first round, Don and Tom presented
            him with a gold-painted plaster Buddha. When LSI went public in May 1983 (having had sales of $5 million in
            1982) it raised the largest sum ever achieved in a technology IPO: $183 million. Some months later Sequoia
            distributed over $20 million on the $600,000 investment.</span></p>
            <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>BY FAR DON&#39;S GRANDEST accomplishment was Cisco Systems - whose early history
            should serve as a masterclass in the art of venture investing and whose name, for several years, was
            composed entirely of lower-case letters. Cisco had been started in 1984 by Sandy and Len Bosack, a husband
            and wife team who had worked in a pair of Stanford&#39;s computer labs and had jerry-rigged a system to link
            the University&#39;s different computer networks. Sandy was forceful, opinionated and confrontational and
            the driving force behind the formation of the business - the sort of character Don always found attractive.
            Len, by contrast, was quiet, shy and introverted. It was always Sandy who forced Len to finish the
            engineering projects he was prone to leave incomplete.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sandy and Len used their credit cards to finance Cisco and had assembled its first
            systems in their living room. Eventually, to keep the company going, they mortgaged their home, and relied
            on sales reps (rather than full time salesforce) and contract engineers. In both 1985 and 1986 the company
            had sales of about $130,000. By the founders&#39; own count they talked to several dozen investors before
            realizing that to have any hope of raising capital they needed what would pass for &#39;professional
            management&#39; and hired a co and CFO - neither of whom had the qualifications for their positions. In the
            year ending July 1987, Cisco had sales of $1.5 million and net income of around $150,000.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was at this juncture that we were introduced to the company by Ed Leonard, a
            Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison partner and former Navy fighter pilot, one of whose colleagues belonged to
            the same flying club as the Cisco president. Ed contacted one firm that had a conflict, another that never
            returned the call and Gordon Russell at Sequoia. Gordy, who knew Ed from working together on Circadian, a
            heart monitoring company, relayed the lead to Don. And thus began a shining example of Sequoia teamwork. For
            if there is ever a company that showed the effect of gaining a substantial ownership position (rather than
            trace amounts) and thereafter engaging in active venture participation - it is Cisco. This was Sequoia&#39;s
            &#39;Full Monty&#39; - (British slang for everything which is necessary. appropriate or possible - aka
            &#39;the works.&quot;)</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we conducted our Cisco due diligence the background atmospherics provided by the
            stock market were dramatic. On &#39;Black Monday&#39; October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones fell 23%, its
            largest-ever one-day decline, and that paralyzed many investors for weeks. The following Monday Thom Weisel,
            the head of Montgomery Securities (one of the leading banks of the era), came for lunch. It was as if the
            world had ended. Thom&#39;s advice, &#39;Stop buying. It&#39;s over.&#39; </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite the grim backcloth, Don had been interested in what he had heard about the
            eccentricity of Sandy and Len and became more intrigued as he learned about the emergence of TCP/IP as a
            communications protocol for connecting computer networks. The fact that whetted his appetite more than
            anything was that the seven-person company was generating revenue without a sales force. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the partners meeting where the Cisco investment was approved, Don, as was his
            wont, dwelled on all the company&#39;s weaknesses- the large number of existing and potential competitors,
            the complaints we had heard from HP&#39;s Dan Warmenhoven (who later became the CEO of NetApp and a longtime
            Sequoia ally), the absence of what he called &#39;everything&#39; or anything to do with the management of
            sales, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and finance - and its 50% gross margins which he considered
            lamentable. As Don girded himself for game-time (which he did before every investment for which he became
            responsible), his expression became so grim, his recitation of Cisco&#39;s short- coming so dire, the
            premonitions of doom so ominous, that I remember wondering why we were investing. At the end of his dirge he
            announced with much solemnity, &#39;We need to make at least twenty-five million from this investment to
            justify the effort.&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The $2.5 million invested in Cisco bought one third of the company, Sandy and Len
            retained another third (66.6% of which was subject to four-year vesting), while the remaining third was
            reserved for future management and the other five employees of the business.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In addition to the members of Sequoia who were at the partners meeting when the Cisco
            investment was approved were three other attendees. Two were from the French bank, Indo-Suez, with whom at
            the time we co-managed a fund, The other attendee, whom Don always addressed as &#39;Mister Koh, had been
            charged by the government of Singapore to learn about the venture business and establish an investment
            office in California. For about a year Mr. Koh perched at Sequoia. I mention this because in these days,
            when companies stay private for a decade and raise billions of dollars, the $2.5 million invested in Cisco -
            the only equity raised by the company prior to its IPO - stands in sharp contrast. Our ownership level meant
            that the investment, if it worked, would have a massive influence on the overall return of the fund.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sequoia Capital IV and its affiliated funds - one for the Sequoia Technology partners
            and the other for employees of The Capital Group-invested $1.965 million; the Stanford University
            Engineering Fund (which Don, along with a group of other venture investors helped manage, $35,000); the
            Indo-Suez fund contributed $400,000; and when Don said, &#39;Mister Koh, how much do you want?&#39; the
            answer was $100,000. The investment closed on December 14, 1987- 55 days after the stock market crash</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the same month that the investment closed, three significant events occurred, all
            of which had to do with Sequoia. Don immediately press-ganged Pierre Lamond to become acting head of
            engineering at Cisco. As it got rolling, Pierre spent part of several days a week at the company and, over
            the first five years, churned through three engineering managers until he recruited one in whom he had
            confidence. He continued to attend Cisco&#39;s engineering meetings long after the company went public, and
            is Sequoia&#39;s great unsung hero in this investment (as he was at both Microchip and C-Cube Microsystems
            where he shouldered much of the burden although Don was also the Chairman of both those companies).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">The second big development was Don&#39;s recruitment of Terry Eger as head of sales,
            who became his favorite salesman of all time. Don liked the way Terry said he would take stock in lieu of
            commissions, admired his missile-force directness, his impatience with formal reports and organization
            structures and the way that he carried everything around in his head rather than on paper. Don said of
            Terry, &#39;it didn&#39;t matter to him where the customer was located. If the customer was on a canoe in
            the middle of Hudson Bay, he&#39;d find a way to land a sea plane in the middle of Hudson Bay and talk to
            him.&#39; Terry was rarely at Cisco&#39;s office - he was either recruiting, with customers, or at Sequoia
            complaining to Don about everything that was wrong with the company. But within a year, Terry had assembled
            the most lethal North American sales force in the networking business and provided Cisco with a distribution
            machine capable of selling all sorts of networking equipment.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The third prod came when Don pressed the small Cisco team to raise prices, a
            reflection of his obsession with gross margins. Between the start of 1988 and 1990, Cisco&#39;s gross
            margins rose from 55% to 65%. Meantime, Don had applauded Cisco&#39;s embrace of outsourced manufacturing
            and had also built a Board of Directors in whom he had confidence - one being a cofounder of LSI Logic and
            another the CFO of Octel, then the leading supplier of voicemail systems.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first major Cisco drama occurred six months after the financing closed, when
            Sandy and Len informed Don that they wanted to fire the CEO that they had hired. This was the first and only
            time when Don stepped in, albeit briefly, as a CEO to fill the void before the arrival of an interim general
            manager - a silvery-haired, avuncular figure with a history in the semiconductor business.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A CEO search was initiated and, eventually, Don settled on John Morgridge, then aged
            55, who became Cisco&#39;s thirty-fourth employee and who appealed to Don because, beyond having been
            instrumental in the rise of Stratus (a maker of fault-tolerant minicomputers), he had just suffered a career
            setback as the head of a failed portable computer company and had one last shot at redemption. (It was the
            same pattern recruiting someone who could not afford to fail - that worked, in earlier days, with Wilf
            Corrigan at LSI Logic and, in later days, when Don recruited Dan Warmenhoven to run NetApp.) John also had a
            reputation for being even more frugal than Don. Later Don admitted that John grasped Cisco&#39;s potential
            better than he did. When John told him he would run Cisco until sales hit a billion dollars Don said, &#39;I
            thought to myself, &#39;you&#39;ve got to be kidding,&#39; I won&#39;t live that long.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">These Sequoia administered booster shots had an enormous effect. By Cisco&#39;s 1989
            fiscal year, sales had risen to $28 million and net income to $4 million. One year later those numbers has
            reached $69 million and $14 million. Cisco&#39;s IPO took place in February 1990 (after the manage- ment had
            received extensive presentation coaching from a figure Don dubbed &#39;The Dean of Charm School&quot;) with
            a pre-money valuation of $182 million and Sequoia&#39;s pre-money ownership standing at a spectacular
            29.2%.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Drama was a leitmotif at Cisco, as it is in many companies, but here it happened to
            involve drive-by shootings in the parking lot, which on some mornings required an employee to pick up spent
            cartridges off the floor of their East Palo Alto headquarters. There was also a dust-up that surprised even
            Don, a veteran of the rough-and-tumble chip industry, when a fist fight erupted between two members of
            Cisco&#39;s management. But the biggest drama came some six months after the IPO and involved the departure
            of Sandy and Len. Contrary to many accounts, the die was cast not by Don but by seven members of the
            management team who suddenly appeared one morning at Sequoia to inform him that either Sandy had to go or
            they would all quit. Ironically, Don was viewed by the management as Sandy&#39;s protector because it was no
            secret that he admired her self-appointed role as the VP of customer advocacy and appreciated the fire she
            displayed. But the deed was done and when Sandy quit so did Len. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another hallmark of Cisco&#39;s formative years was its approach to acquisitions,
            which was heavily influenced by guidance from customers who would meet directly with the engineering
            organization. It was feedback from Boeing that led to Cisco&#39;s 1993 purchase of Crescendo Systems (also
            Sequoia backed), which at the time was an engineering group with a product-network switches - but no
            distribution. Crescendo&#39;s projections for its first year of sales was $10 million. More than $100
            million of Crescendo switches were sold in the first year as part of Cisco, a fine illustration of the
            benefits of minimizing time to market.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">By the time John Morgridge, who Don had come to consider a spiritual soul-mate,
            passed the CEO mantle to John Chambers in 1995, Cisco had passed $2 billion in sales and had 2,250
            employees. Don and John both stayed on Cisco&#39;s board until they retired together in 2006 - 29 years
            after Sequoia&#39;s original investment.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the years immediately following our Cisco distribution I often stared at the
            financial statements for Sequoia Capital IV, and wondered how we would ever top the investment. At the time
            I thought it impossible. Our distribution of Cisco taught me two lessons. The first was that the decline in
            computing cost would continue to expand the size of markets that Sequoia-backed companies can pursue, thus
            making it possible for several more generations to always top the returns of their predecessors. That
            remains true today</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">our future returns should always eclipse our past returns. The second lesson was that
            the leading company in a rapidly growing market can flourish for years if not decades. As Cisco&#39;s
            revenues and profits continued to grow, the value of the company followed suit. By 1993 Cisco&#39;s market
            cap reached $7 billion and by 1994 (the year in which Cisco first appeared on the Fortune 500) it exceeded
            $10 billion. At the end of 1998, before the world was completely swept up in the dotcom hurricane, Cisco had
            a market value of $176 billion. Eventually, I learned another lesson, Anything is PossibleTM,</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>AT THE TIME I first met Don, then aged 54, I asked him whether he planned to
            retire anytime soon. He ruefully admitted that others had asked him the same question and shook his head.
            Understandably, as the years passed, his attitude changed. After twenty years in the venture business he no
            longer wanted to feel imprisoned by the obligation of being legally responsible to external clients. While
            Don enjoyed thinking about and discussing investments, by the time he reached his early sixties he, quite
            understandably, started to find some aspects of managing Sequoia exasperating and he felt a little unsettled
            by not knowing the details of all our investments as the partnerships grew in size.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don had become allergic not just to the oak trees that dot the Northern California
            landscape, but also to the increasing rate of tax levied by the state of California. He had bought a home in
            Arizona which, to make his legal residence, meant that he had to spend at least six months a year outside
            the Golden State. He was also affected by the retirement decision of Gordy Russell, the partner to whom he
            felt closest. Don edged away from the business earlier than most people realize - before smartphones,
            e-mail, texts and travel transformed the rhythm of the business. He handled all this with the minimum of
            drama and did not dwell on either the decision or timing. I suspect he understood that to do so would only
            trigger politicking and anxiety. So while for outsiders the change in Don&#39;s role was imperceptible, for
            those of us on the inside it was clear. He knew it was the time for others, he understood he should no
            longer be the face of Sequoia and he was careful not to overstay his welcome.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite the urban myths that have been put about, when Don decided to back away from
            Sequoia, there was no grand plan of succession. There was no formal anointment of successors, no
            announcement and no handing over ceremony. This was not surprising given that in all his prior roles - as a
            junior contributor at Sylvania and Raytheon; as a successful head of sales and marketing at Fairchild; and
            as a cofounder at National Semiconductor - Don had never needed to concern himself with who was going to
            lead the organization. Sequoia was the first time Don had confronted the challenge and as he said when he
            and I met in early 1992 he had a sense of &#39;apr&egrave;s moi le deluge.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After consulting Larry Sonsini about how Wilson Sonsini handled succession he had
            concluded that there was no recipe and that the rivalries and jostling that exist between people in their
            thirties or forties made the chances for a successful transition at Sequoia slim. While he certainly did not
            want Sequoia to fail, Don also did not expect it to thrive in his absence. In 1989, even with Don at the
            helm, we had struggled to scrape together $64 million for our fifth venture fund because so much of our
            Growth Fund remained uninvested. (Don, whose signals were often oblique, labeled the management partnership
            for this fund &#39;PR&#39; - for farewell and retirement. By the end of 1992, with the formation of our
            sixth venture fund, the impending change in his role was set in stone when Don chose Omega - the final
            letter in the Greek alphabet - for the name of that Managing Partnership.)</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Contrary to popular legend, Don did not &#39;give&#39; Sequoia to a younger
            generation. &quot;The verb &#39;give&#39; does not exist in my version of Webster&#39;s Dictionary,&#39; Don
            would say if a CEO sloppily suggested during a presentation that Sequoia should give his company a certain
            investment. The same applied within Sequoia as Don retreated. However Don was aware of the deleterious
            consequences of an older generation hogging their share of the economics for too long. He knew that in most
            instances this triggered the rupture of partnerships. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unlike some of his generation, he never tried to put a value on the management
            company and sell his stake to the rest of us. (This is also why today Sequoia is organized in such a way
            that it cannot be taken public in order to enrich one generation.) Instead, when he and I sat down to
            discuss his economics there would be a little bit of good-natured jousting but by then the conversations had
            become easy. Don never insisted on a number, or a percentage, and never over-reached. He always accepted
            what we gave him and he left it to us to decide. At no time did any of us feel gouged.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">During his retreat from daily obligations, Don shifted responsibilities and also
            tilted the pinball machine when necessary. Responsibilities for limited partners were given to others, and
            when Wilf Corrigan called to refer an LSI employee whom he labeled as one of the smartest people in the
            company, Don delegated responsibility for Jen-Hsun Huang and nVidia to the next generation. When both Yahoo!
            and Flextronics, a contract manufacturing services business, proved to be investments that provoked
            controversy within Sequoia, Don helped thwart the opposition.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is rarely a time when a leader steps away and everything is humming. That was
            true too for Sequoia. Just because things happened a long time ago, doesn&#39;t mean they were smooth, so
            don&#39;t believe the airbrushing that invariably occurs as people try to recapture the past. Remember,
            nostalgia is never what it was.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the years prior to Don&#39;s retreat, we had experienced a fair amount of
            personnel turnover and had yet to figure out how to staff a growth equity team and give the activity the
            attention it deserved. During the latter part of the 1980s and 1990s, we had permitted Summit Partners and
            T.A. Associates to run away with a business which, at Sequoia, at least in the U.S., has really only come
            into its own in the past few years. As for healthcare, we struggled - partly because of the taxing nature of
            the market and partly because of the lack of internal support from a group more inclined to make electronics
            investments. In 1996, our total headcount was just seventeen - eight investors, three in finance, four
            assistants, a receptionist and our vast IT department consisted of one part-timer managing an e-mail server
            stored in a kitchen closet, a two channel ISDN modem to connect to the internet and a color Laser Writer
            stashed beneath the desk of our receptionist.</span></p>
            <hr>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0"><br>LIKE EVERYONE, Don found the transition to a role where he had perceived
            authority but no responsibility challenging. As usual, he summed up the dilemma in a pithy manner,
            &#39;Kings in this business don&#39;t die. They stay around. There&#39;s nothing worse than having a King
            who refuses to die.</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Former Kings are a pain in the ass. They&#39;re all like the Duke of Windsor.&quot;
            But unlike the former King of England, Don did not set up a separate court, or engage in subversive politics
            and neither did he feel a need for the trappings of</span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">a former leader.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">While I knew he disapproved of many of our initiatives, he kept his feelings to
            himself and did not sow seeds of discontent. There was a part of him that understood Sequoia&#39;s long-term
            health depended on giving younger After past. members who had made major contributions the freedom, upturn
            the wherever necessary, to reinvent and all, investing principles don&#39;t change, but the mechanics that
            work in one era doesn&#39;t necessarily extend to the next. Unlike other retired investors who took to
            publicly criticizing their prior partnerships, Don was the soul of discretion.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Intervention or direct admonitions were very rare. Don saved his shots for when they
            were needed. Once, after an LP meeting he rightly upbraided me a for being too harsh. And after we got
            ourselves in a pickle with a whole rush of silly investments in 1999, Don made one of his rare interventions
            and administered a necessary colonic via a note jotted down on a sheet which listed our troubled
            investments. As always it was in green, in capital letters and carried no signature. But the message I
            received was fair, appropriate and unambiguous.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For some years after his management responsibilities had ceased, whenever he was in
            California, Don attended partners meetings but would maintain a stony silence throughout the proceedings. He
            would volunteer an opinion when asked but would never, as ever, speak first and always refrained from saying
            anything after the debate had finished. He knew too when the time was right to stop attending these
            sessions.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eventually, he withdrew from all investment activity (save for one small healthcare
            company he nursed along. which helped stroke treatment) and derived more pleasure from activities in Arizona
            and Montana than involving himself with Sequoia investments in young companies in Silicon Valley. He found
            more time for golf and continued with his Stakhanovite approach to summer vacations. These often started
            with a visit to London where he immediately made a beeline for a coach who helped him with his golf swing
            before traveling to Scotland where, come rain or shine, he would play two rounds on as many days as
            possible. His location of the Gates of Heaven was the spot in Scotland closest to St. Andrews, Carnoustie,
            Muirfield and Royal Troon. When in Alaska, he got more of a frisson from proximity to bears than he did from
            casting a rod.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He came to enjoy attending Sequoia suppers and playing poker at general partner
            meetings with younger aces from every part of our business. He made the occasional comment during limited
            partners&#39; meetings and when he did they were pointed. For example, in 2010, when we hauled all of our
            clients to Beijing to attend a meeting during one of China&#39;s colder winters, Don asked a Chinese guest
            what was on everyone else&#39;s mind, namely whether offshore investors&#39; money was treated the same as
            domestic investors. Don was satisfied when he was given an equally candid answer, &#39;no.&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don was a ready source of advice for those who stopped by his office and I sometimes
            dropped by just to talk to him about topics I couldn&#39;t discuss with others. Now, I regret not stopping
            by more often just to keep him apprised of what was happening. Once, bemoaning the fact that investments
            never got more straightforward, I saw a flash of vintage Don. I asked, &#39;Why does it not get any
            easier?&#39; His answer, &#39;Why should it?&#39;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Beyond Sequoia, Don had a long involvement with the San Francisco Symphony, and much
            admired its musical director, Michael Tilson Thomas, with whom he was still chatting last summer. He served
            on the Symphony&#39;s board of governors for several years and led the effort to raise money to furnish the
            players with higher quality instruments a pursuit which eventually led him to Cremona, about an hour south
            of Milan, which is the birthplace of Stradivarius and still a center of violin making. The experience with
            the Symphony taught him that he was temperamentally ill-suited to sit on the boards of not-for-profits
            (frustrated, for example, by long debates about the importance of having the orchestra rank at the top of
            some New York Times ranking) so when he received an invitation to join the board of the San Francisco Opera,
            he demurred and instead became a member of the Opera Guild, which finances musical education. He developed a
            morbid fascination with the plots of operas which he studied closely and with wry detachment.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&#39;s two major sporting interests were American football and golf, but he
            admired all kinds of athletic achievement, including the soccer games he watched at Stanford as part of the
            1994 World Cup. He was a devoted fan of the Oakland Raiders, perhaps drawn by the outcast sensibility
            fostered by its longtime principal owner and general manager, Al Davis; or by its emblem - which is a black
            and silver pirate; or by the fact that during the 1970s it was one of the most successful franchises in
            American sports. Don was a frequent attendee of Stanford football games and an admirer of Tom Brady, the
            nine-time Superbowl quarterback, who recorded a video message for him as his days dwindled down. As for
            golf, Don was one of the legions of admirers of the affable man from Latrobe, Pennsylvania, Arnold Palmer,
            and treated invitations to Augusta like visits to the Vatican. As for baseball, the only game I recall Don
            attending was Game three of the 1989 World Series between the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics
            at San Francisco&#39;s Candlestick Park. He was saved from having to watch a sport he did not particularly
            cherish because thirty-one minutes prior to game-time, the 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake sent concrete
            crumbling from the upper decks of the stadium. (The game was played ten days later.)</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">During his active days, Don was a devoted supporter of the Stanford School of
            Engineering and helped orchestrate the Stanford Engineering Venture Fund, which became a model for
            universities across the nation. The gains from this fund were so great that they paid for the construction
            of the new quad for the School of Engineering. Don was also a keen supporter of medical research which,
            among other causes, he supported with his family foundation.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The happiest I ever saw Don was when he was in the company of Jim Martin from the
            Capital Group or Pat Foley, the former CEO of DHL. Pat had started life as a hotel clerk before working his
            way over three decades to the chairmanship of Hyatt Hotels. Pat, a large, gregarious fellow would arrive in
            the office like a politician looking for votes - greeting people by name, shaking everyone&#39;s hand and
            gossiping about the absurdity of the venture business. There was an element of laughter and carefree
            frivolity to Don when the pair of them headed off to play golf chortling like a pair of teenagers.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Don slowed and as the indignities of old age became increasingly visible, he kept
            his family life and the arrival and growth of grandchildren to himself. After he had signs of possible skin
            cancer removed from his face, he just sat in his office holding an ice-pack over the swellings. Later, he
            always brushed off questions about his health or hospital visits and maintained a stoical attitude as his
            once well-fitted jackets became looser and the hardening set in. Don was not inclined to self-pity and, on
            the few occasions when he was so struck, it involved the death of a person close to him such as Jim Martin
            and Pat Foley&#39;s wife, Paula. As Don aged I sometimes thought about an incident decades earlier when we
            had all gone to lunch at another firm and the wheelchair of its aging cofounder, who looked as if he had
            just been exhumed from a catacomb, was pushed in by a younger partner. Watching this scene Don had muttered
            that, when his time came, he never wanted to be treated as a museum piece. His pride and dignity ensured
            that he wasn&#39;t.</span></p>
    <p class="c2 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Until his final few months Don still drove himself from Woodside to Sand Hill Road.
            He would park his red Mercedes two-seater car with the license plate, TAIPANY, opposite the entry to the
            office. He would give a warm greeting to the receptionists, badger Margot to replace the batteries in the
            small desk clocks that decorated his office and then summon I.T. to help with a computer issue. But
            gradually the sightings became less frequent until, during his last few months, they stopped, and the spot
            usually occupied by TAIPANV was empty.</span></p>
